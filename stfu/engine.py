"""Wires source, detector, strikes, actions, and log together.

Two clocks are threaded through deliberately. `mono` is a monotonic seconds
value used for every duration decision (cooldown, suppression), because wall
time can jump backwards across DST and NTP corrections and a jump backwards
would freeze the cooldown. `wall` is real calendar time, used for session
boundaries and log timestamps, which have to mean something to a human reading
the report.
