"""Wiring, lifecycle, and device watch: turns the engine into an app.

Three threads want attention here -- Tk (main), audio capture, and pystray.

**This module owns the only `tk.Tk()` in the running app** (the hidden pump
root below), with one sanctioned exception: `firstrunui.FirstRunWizard`,
which runs before this root exists and is destroyed before it is created.
Every window elsewhere in `stfu/` -- the overlay, the desktop message, the
report, settings, the meter, the calibration dialog, the PIN prompt -- is a
`tk.Toplevel` of this root, not a `Tk()` of its own, and none of them call
`.mainloop()`. `tests/test_single_tk_root.py` enforces this mechanically.

That used to not be true, and it produced five separate field bugs: settings
rendering blank (variables bound to the wrong interpreter), the PIN prompt
opening as a bare untitled window (a PhotoImage bound to the wrong
interpreter, throwing before the dialog finished building), a deadlocked
capture thread, a desktop message whose nested mainloop() never returned (so
the re-entry guard around it never cleared and later strikes played sound
with no window), and a PIN-gated tray item whose window never appeared after
the PIN was accepted. Patching each instance individually never held; only
removing the second interpreter did.

A caller that genuinely needs to block until a window closes (the PIN
prompt's `gate()`, so a menu action does not fire before the PIN is checked)
uses `master.wait_window(toplevel)` -- Tk's supported modal mechanism, which
reliably returns once the window is destroyed and does not share `mainloop()`'s
quit()-flag ambiguity (see point 2 below). Every other window's `show()`
returns as soon as it has built its Toplevel; `_BridgedWindow` below finds out
when it actually closes via the Toplevel's own `<Destroy>` event.

Two more things below are still true with a single interpreter:

1. `_pump` reschedules its own next call *before* draining the bridge queue,
   so the hidden root always has a pending timer. `wait_window()` (used by
   the PIN gate) runs its own nested event-processing loop while it waits,
   and depends on that timer to keep firing during the wait.

2. Shutdown ends the hidden root with `destroy()`, never `quit()`. `quit()`
   sets a flag shared by every mainloop() call on this thread, and with two
   or more `Tk()` instances it would be consumed by whichever mainloop() is
   currently innermost rather than this root's own -- moot now that this is
   the only mainloop() in the process, but `destroy()` is the correct call
   regardless: it is scoped to this widget and unwinds its own mainloop()
   deterministically.

    without blocking the caller.

    It used to block, via bridge.submit(), on the theory that actions.fire()
    should not return until the window it opened had closed. That was wrong,
    and it deadlocked the app in the field: fire() runs on the *capture*
    thread, so blocking it stops audio being read at all. The overlay waits
    for four clicks and the fullscreen message for ten seconds -- during which
    nothing was detected -- and if either window failed to close for any
    reason, detection was dead permanently. Real logs showed exactly one
    trigger per session, then silence.

    Nothing actually needed the block. The engine's suppression window comes
    from the sound clip's duration, which ActionRegistry already obtains
    before the window is opened.

    A window still showing is not reopened: two overlays stacked on each other
    would be worse than one, and the cooldown means it can only happen when
    something has already gone wrong.

    The re-entry guard used to be cleared in a `finally` around the window's
    own `mainloop()`, which only ran once that call returned. Now that
    `show()` on the window classes themselves returns immediately (see
    overlay.py), there is no call to hang a `finally` off any more -- so the
    guard is cleared by the Toplevel's own `<Destroy>` event instead, which
    fires exactly once, whenever and however the window actually closes. A
    guard that can only be set and never guaranteed to clear is worse than no
    guard at all (that was bug #4: a desktop message's nested mainloop() never
    returned, so this flag latched on and silently ate strikes 3 and 4). If
    the window fails to even build, the `except` below clears it directly,
    since no Toplevel -- and so no `<Destroy>` event -- ever existed.
